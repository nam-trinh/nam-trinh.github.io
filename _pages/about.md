Hello There!!!

My name is Nam. I'm a Machine Learning engineer with expertise on deep learning for speech data and natural language processing. I'm currently working as a research assistant in the Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics, Dublin City University where I develop machine learning models for improving people's mental well-being                                                                        .

A few words about myself: 
1. A "Tab", "Visual Studio Code" and "Git" person
2. A curious engineer
3. A highly motivated researcher
4. An (occassional) guitarist 
5. A bookaholic 
6. A travelholic 

I launch this site just to share some of my ML projects. Hopefully I can get some feedbacks from you guys.
