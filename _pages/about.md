My name is Nam. I consider myself as Machine Learning Engineer with 4 years of experience expertise on deep learning for speech data and natural language processing. Previously I was working as a MLE in the Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics, Dublin City University where I develop machine learning models for improving people's mental well-being by developing a pipeline of speech recognition and text sentiment analysis for the task of speech emotion classification. Currently I'm working in the Huawei Ireland Research Centre as a Research Data Scientist Intern where I help Huawei build speech-related and image retrieval applications.                                                         

A few words about myself: 
1. A "Tab", "Visual Studio Code" and "Git" person
2. A curious engineer
3. A highly motivated researcher
4. An (occassional) guitarist 
5. A bookaholic 
6. A travelholic 

I launch this site to share some of my ML personal projects and tutorials.
