Hello! My name is Nam, and I am currently a PhD candidate at Dublin City University (DCU), where I conduct research using machine learning to model brain data during the human decision-making process. With 4 years of experience in machine learning, I specialize in deep learning for brain data (EEG and MRI), speech data and natural language processing.

Additionally, I am working with a startup named Zazu, where I employ large language models (LLMs) to generate questionnaires for drug feedback collection from drug trials in clinical research.

Previously in 2021, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at the Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics, Dublin City University. There, I developed machine learning models aimed at improving mental well-being by creating a pipeline for speech recognition and text sentiment analysis for speech emotion classification. In 2022, I was a Research Data Scientist Intern at Huawei Ireland Research Centre, where I help build speech-related and image retrieval applications.

A few words about myself:

1. "Tab", "Visual Studio Code", and "Git" person
2. An engineer
3. An (occasional) guitarist

I launched this site to share some of my personal ML projects and tutorials. If you have any feedback or comments, please reach me at trinh.hoai.nam.93(at)gmail.com.
