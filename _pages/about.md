Hello There!!!

My name is Nam. I'm a Machine Learning engineer with expertise on deep learning for speech data and natural language processing. I'm currently working as a research assistant in the Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics, Dublin City University where I develop machine learning models for improving people's mental well-being                                                                        .

A few words about myself: 
1. A "Tab", "Visual Studio Code" and "Git" person
2. A curious engineer
3. A highly motivated researcher
4. An (occassional) guitarist (well, I can play a few songs in a party if you require me ...)
5. A bookaholic (I read books everyday so I guess the word "bookaholic" suits me)
6. A travelholic (I've traveled to almost all over Vietnam, Japan and a few EU countries and of course, they were before the Covid-19 ...)

I launch this site just to show off some of my humble knowledge in ML and technology. Hopefully I can get some feedbacks from you guys.
