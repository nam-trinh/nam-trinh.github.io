Hello There!!!

My name is Nam. I'm a Machine Learning engineer with expertise on deep learning for speech and natural language processing. I'm currently working as a research assistant in the Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics, Dublin City University where I develop full stack machine learning pipelines for AI employed in mental healthcare. 

A few words about myself: 
1. A "Tab", "Visual Studio Code" and "Git" person
2. A curious engineer
3. A highly motivated researcher
4. An (occassional) guitarist (well, I can play a few songs in a party if you require me ...)
5. A bookaholic (I read books everyday so I guesss the word "bookaholic" suits me)
6. A travelholic (I've traveled to Japan, and a few EU countries and of course, they were before the Covid-19 ...)
