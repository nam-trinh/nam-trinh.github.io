Abstract:
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent psychological disorder characterized by attention deficits and high impulsivity, impacting both adults and children. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of task-related electroencephalography (EEG) and resting-state EEG in distinguishing adult patients with ADHD from healthy controls. Machine learning techniques are employed to classify the patientsâ€™ status based on EEG features. The primary objective of this investigation is to determine whether the classification performance of task-based EEG data recorded during a stop-signal task recruiting inhibitory processes outperforms that of resting-state EEG data. We hypothesize that task-based EEG data contains valuable biomarkers related to inhibitory control that can be utilized to detect ADHD, whereas resting-state EEG data does not possess such useful biomarkers.
